In this tutorial we will just give a hint on some of the important topics which we will require here but we will ourselves dont cover here."

    "Markov chain is a system that experience transition from one state to another. This transition is only based on the past state. For example, the probability that it will rain tomorrow depends only on the weather conditions today (if our system transitions from one state to another where time resolution is a day). This property is called <i>memoryless property</i>. This transition from one state to another happens probabilistically (based on a state transition matrix). Sine we collect a sequence of events (where the state changes probabilistically and not deterministically), we call Markov chain as a stochastic process.\n",

    "Ergodicity is an important property of Markov chain which we will use in this tutorial. It has two properties:\n",
    "1. Aperiodic: the Markov chain is not periodic. It does not return to one of its states periodically in fixed number of steps\n",
    "2. Recurrent/irreducible: we should be able to reach from one state to another in finite number of steps with non-zero probability. It simply means, we are not getting stuck in one of the states (absorbing state) or missing out one of the states"

    "Random number is a function that draws samples from a distribution. For example, if we know the mean and variance of data of interest (example height of adults in USA), we can draw a sample from that distribution. This sample is called random number and process is called random number generation. \n",

    "We use random number generation in simulation. For example, if we understand the past behavior of a user when we give them coupons, we can simulate how will they behave in future. There are a lot of system which we simulate because sometimes it is very hard to solve a problem analytically. Most of large systems are simulated for many years. For example, if a factory decides to buy a new machine, they will simulate as how much cost it will reduce for the company if they buy it. Since they have not bought it, they need to simulate the system. And for simulation and its analysis, we need data. This data is generated (or sampled from distribution) using random number generation. \n",

By random number, we can not only check how our proposed solution (of buying or not buying that machine) will perform, we can also check what can be the worst case scenario (may be it will slow the speed of manufacturing as employees cannot move fast in the shop floor)."

We also know that points lying outside the radius are not within the circle. So the area is given by 4 x proportion lying inside circle. Process is:\n",
