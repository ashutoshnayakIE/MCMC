# MCMC

MCMC is listed as one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century. In this tutorial, we go through what is MCMC, when it is required and 
how to implement MCMC in python. We will also discuss a python library pymc3 for MCMC simulation.
NOTE: THis is incomplete and ongoing

# Contents
The following is the list of content we cover in this tutorial. We do not cover all of them extensively but enough so that you can go ahead with MCMC. We assume that you have an idea of bayesian statistics and random number generation.
1. Bayes Theorem
2. Markov Chains
3. Random Numbers
4. Monte Carlo Simulation
5. Common Random Number
6. Random Number generation
  6.1. Gibbs Sampling
  6.2. Metropolis-Hastings
